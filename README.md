# New Server Setup
For automated setup, use a stack script. For manual setup, use a guide.

## Bash Scripts

#### Usage:
- Add script to your server (`nano /path/to/script.sh`)
- Paste contents of the script into file you just created and then save and exit
- Give **execute** permission to the script (`chmod +x /path/to/script.sh`)
- Now run the script: `/path/to/script.sh`

> Tip: create and run the scripts as the root user
